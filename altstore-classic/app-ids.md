# ðŸ†” App IDs

Every app you sideload with AltStore requires a certain number of "App IDs" to be registered with your Apple ID, which depends on the number of app extensions each app contains. **You can only register up to 10 App IDs at a time**, but each App ID expires after one week. If you want to sideload an app that requires more App IDs than you have available, you'll have to wait for enough App IDs to expire.

To see a list of all App IDs registered with your Apple ID and when they will expire, tap "View App IDs" from the My Apps tab.
