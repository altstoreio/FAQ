# üèéÔ∏è Enabling JIT

Just-In-Time Compilation (JIT)  is a technology that allows certain types of apps to run significantly faster, or even at all. iOS does not normally allow apps to use JIT for security reasons, but you can enable JIT for apps sideloaded with AltStore Classic by following the instructions below.

{% hint style="info" %}
Using JIT requires a one-time setup with a Mac or PC. For an alternative method of enabling JIT, see [AltJIT](altjit.md).
{% endhint %}

## Set-up Instructions

{% hint style="info" %}
These instructions only need to be done once to set your device up to use JIT.
