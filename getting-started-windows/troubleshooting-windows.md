# 🙋 Troubleshooting (Windows)

#### <mark style="color:purple;">I followed the instructions, but I still can't install AltStore.</mark>

Please make sure you did the following. If you are receiving an error, you can refer to the error code page or search for your issue in the top right.

* Have you said “Trust” on both your computer and phone after connecting it to your computer? You can check by opening iTunes and seeing if a dialog box pops up asking if you want to trust your phone.
* Try using another Apple ID. If necessary, you can [create a new Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/account#!\&page=create) specifically for use with AltStore for free.
* Make sure iTunes and/or iCloud are running while using AltServer.
* Right-click AltServer and choose “Run as Administrator”.
* Did you install iTunes or iCloud from the Microsoft Store? If so, you’ll need to uninstall them and download the latest versions directly from Apple.

#### <mark style="color:purple;">AltStore freezes/takes forever to sign-in.</mark>

This could happen for a number of reasons. If you’re experiencing this issue, please check the following

* Your Windows firewall might be blocking incoming network connections to AltServer. You must enable network access for AltServer in your firewall settings for it to receive refreshed apps from AltStore.
* Did you install iTunes or iCloud from the Microsoft Store? If so, you’ll need to uninstall them and download the latest versions directly from Apple.
* You may need to make sure iTunes and iCloud are running on your computer as well.
* Are you on public/work/school WiFi? If so, your WiFi might be preventing devices from discovering each other. Try connecting to your phone’s hotspot and trying again.
* Have you said “Trust” on both your computer and phone after connecting it to your computer? You can check by opening iTunes and seeing if a dialog box pops up asking if you want to trust your phone.
* Finally, try plugging your phone into your computer. This will fix almost all connectivity problems, but will mean AltStore most likely won't be able to refresh apps for you in the background over WiFi.

#### <mark style="color:purple;">AltStore says “Could not find AltServer” when trying to refresh.</mark>

This means AltStore could not discover a running AltServer on the same WiFi network. If you’re getting this error, try the following:

* Make sure AltServer is running and connected to the same WiFi network as AltStore.
* Your Windows firewall might be blocking incoming network connections to AltServer. You must enable network access for AltServer in your firewall settings for it to receive refreshed apps from AltStore.
* Did you install iTunes or iCloud from the Microsoft Store? If so, you’ll need to uninstall them and download the latest versions directly from Apple.
* You may need to make sure iTunes and iCloud are running on your computer as well.

#### <mark style="color:purple;">I’m unable to change my network settings to allow devices to communicate with each other (such as on school/work/public WiFi).</mark>

You can always install and refresh apps without WiFi by plugging your phone in to your computer. However, this means AltStore won't be able to refresh apps for you in the background over WiFi.
