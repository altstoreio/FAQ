# üßë‚Äçüîß Troubleshooting

If you have issues downloading AltStore PAL, make sure to check this guide and see if any of these items apply to you. If you go through this list and still need help, reach out to[ support@altstore.io](mailto:support@altstore.io)



<mark style="color:purple;">**Restart Your Device**</mark>

If you run into any issues while downloading, be sure to first restart your device. This may be required for your device to recognize AltStore and allow you to download. Once you do this, you can continue with the other below suggestions.



<mark style="color:purple;">**Apple ID region must be a country in the European Union**</mark>

AltStore PAL can only be downloaded onto devices physically located in the [European Union](https://european-union.europa.eu/easy-read\_en), and that are logged into an EU Apple ID. You can find your Apple ID's region under Apple ID > Media & Purchases > Country/Region in Settings. And just because we've been asked this a lot, **this does not include the UK.**

For information on how to see your Apple ID region, please see this [page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/118283).



<mark style="color:purple;">**Missing Download Link (Re-Download)**</mark>

You can redownload to the same device at any time by clicking the payment button again and typing in the same email address you used to check out before (or attempt to use Apple Pay again) - Stripe will automatically redirect you to the AltStore PAL download page. You do not need to re-subscribe&#x20;



<mark style="color:purple;">**Your Device is on iOS 17.4+**</mark>

AltStore PAL can only be run on devices running iOS 17.4 or later. Please ensure your device is up to date before trying to install.



<mark style="color:purple;">**Apple Pay**</mark>

There are some issues that may cause Apple Pay to fail, so we suggest making sure your payment has been processed correctly before trying to download AltStore PAL. If your payment continues to fail, we recommend providing a credit card directly or using another payment option.



<mark style="color:purple;">**3rd Party Browsers (Chrome, Arc, Brave, etc.)**</mark>

Currently, Apple only permits installing marketplace apps from the Safari browser. If you've already subscribed using a 3rd party browser, you can copy + paste the URL of the download page to Safari and finish installing AltStore PAL from there.

Optionally you can start the process over again in Safari. Type in the same email address you used to check out before (or attempt to use Apple Pay again), and Stripe will automatically redirect you to the AltStore PAL download page ‚Äî you do NOT need to re-subscribe.



<mark style="color:purple;">**Multiple Devices**</mark>

Currently, AltStore PAL can only be downloaded onto one device per subscription. If you purchased and downloaded to a different device than intended, please send an email to support@altstore.io and we can get things sorted for you.



<mark style="color:purple;">**Still Running into Issues?**</mark>

If you've tried everything above and are still having issues installing AltStore PAL, please start the entire process over again from the [altstore.io](https://altstore.io) homepage. Type in the same email address you used to check out before (or attempt to use Apple Pay again), and Stripe will automatically redirect you to the AltStore PAL download page ‚Äî you do NOT need to re-subscribe.
