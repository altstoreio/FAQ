4\. Connect your iOS device to your computer and make sure it is unlocked. Trust your device with your computer if needed.

5\. Enable "Wi-Fi sync" on your device.

&#x20;**** [**If you see an "Install Mail Plug-in..." alert, follow the instructions on next page.**](enable-mail-plug-in.md)****
{% endhint %}

8\. Enter your Apple ID email address and password. This will allow AltServer to authenticate with Apple and configure your account to support sideloading apps.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your Apple ID and password are sent **only** to Apple — not us or anyone else.
{% endhint %}

9\. Wait a few seconds, then an AltServer notification should appear on your Mac saying AltStore has been successfully installed onto your device.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't see any notifications from AltServer, make sure you've given AltServer permission to send you notifications in System Preferences.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You may need to restart your device to make AltStore appear on your Home Screen.
{% endhint %}

10\.  On your iOS device, go to Settings -> General -> Profiles & Device Management. Tap “Trust \[Your Apple ID],” then tap “Trust” again to confirm.

{% hint style="info" %}
The "Profiles & Device Management" may read as a number of things depending on your version, but you can always find the section near the bottom of Settings -> General.
{% endhint %}
