6\. Click the AltServer icon in the bottom right taskbar. Then go to “Install AltStore” and choose your iOS device.

7\. Enter your Apple ID email address and password. This will allow AltServer to authenticate with Apple and configure your account to support sideloading apps.

Your Apple ID and password are sent **only** to Apple — not us or anyone else.
{% endhint %}

8\. Wait a few seconds, then an AltServer notification should appear saying AltStore has been successfully installed onto your device.

{% hint style="info" %}
You may need to restart your device to make AltStore appear on your Home Screen.
{% endhint %}

9\.  On your iOS device, go to Settings -> General -> Profiles & Device Management. Tap “Trust \[Your Apple ID],” then tap “Trust” again to confirm.
