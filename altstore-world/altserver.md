# üñ•Ô∏è AltServer

AltServer is a companion application for your computer that allows AltStore to sideload apps onto your device. As long as AltStore is on the same WiFi network as a computer running AltServer ‚Äî or is plugged-in directly to the computer via USB ‚Äî AltStore can sideload, refresh, activate, and deactivate apps. AltServer is also used to install AltStore in the first place, and if your AltStore expires you can manually refresh it by re-installing AltStore with AltServer **without** deleting AltStore first.

AltStore will try to automatically refresh your apps throughout the week, so we recommend launching AltServer at computer startup and leaving it running in the background to ensure AltStore can do its job.

If you have trouble using AltServer, please check our [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting-guide.md).
