# 🪟 How to Install AltStore (Windows)

## **Before Installing AltStore:**

1. Download and install the latest version of iTunes **and** iCloud directly from Apple (**not** the Microsoft Store).

{% hint style="info" %}
**iTunes Direct Download Links:**

Windows 64-bit: [https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/win64](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/win64)

Windows 32-bit: [https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/win32](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/win32)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**iCloud Direct Download Link:**

Windows 32-bit and 64-bit: [https://updates.cdn-apple.com/2020/windows/001-39935-20200911-1A70AA56-F448-11EA-8CC0-99D41950005E/iCloudSetup.exe](https://updates.cdn-apple.com/2020/windows/001-39935-20200911-1A70AA56-F448-11EA-8CC0-99D41950005E/iCloudSetup.exe)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you **need** to use the Windows Store version of iCloud, you can still use AltStore by following our alternate steps in the [Troubleshooting Guide](troubleshooting-guide.md#windows-i-need-to-use-the-windows-store-icloud).
{% endhint %}

## **Installing AltStore:**

1. Download [AltServer for Windows](https://cdn.altstore.io/file/altstore/altinstaller.zip)
2. Extract `AltInstaller.zip` and run `Setup.exe`.
3. Go to search in your Windows task bar, then type in "AltServer" and click "Run as administrator." Make sure to allow access to private networks if prompted. AltStore will appear as an icon in the taskbar.

4\. Connect your iOS device to your computer and make sure it is unlocked. Trust your device with your computer if needed.

5\. Open iTunes, then enable "Wi-Fi sync" on your device.

6\. Click the AltServer icon in the bottom right taskbar. Then go to “Install AltStore” and choose your iOS device.

7\. Enter your Apple ID email address and password. This will allow AltServer to authenticate with Apple and configure your account to support sideloading apps.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your Apple ID and password are sent **only** to Apple — not us or anyone else.
{% endhint %}

8\. Wait a few seconds, then an AltServer notification should appear saying AltStore has been successfully installed onto your device.

{% hint style="info" %}
You may need to restart your device to make AltStore appear on your Home Screen.
{% endhint %}

9\. On your iOS device, go to Settings -> General -> Profiles & Device Management. Tap “Trust \[Your Apple ID],” then tap “Trust” again to confirm.

{% hint style="info" %}
"Profiles & Device Management" may read as a number of things depending on your version, but you can always find it near the bottom of Settings -> General.
{% endhint %}

#### Enable Developer Mode (iOS 16+)

11\. To use AltStore on iOS 16 or later, you need to enable Developer Mode on your device by going to Settings -> Privacy and Security -> Developer Mode.
