# üÖøÔ∏è Patreon Integration

## Overview

Apps in AltStore are all free by default, but by creating a Patreon campaign you can choose to offer your apps exclusively to Patrons.

Members of your Patreon can connect their accounts to download any apps they have access to. Once a user installs your app, they'll be able to refresh it and receive updates through AltStore as long as they remain a Patron.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can assign as many apps as you like to a single Patreon campaign. In other words, you don't need individual campaigns for each app in your source.
{% endhint %}



## How it Works

By default, apps marked as Patreon-only will show "Join Patreon" above the download button and be visible to everyone. When an app is downloaded, AltStore will first authenticate with Patreon to verify they are a patron. If they are not a patron, AltStore will direct them to your Patreon page instead.&#x20;

You can optionally limit app downloads to certain tiers by specifying the minimum pledge required in your source JSON. Additionally, you can choose to hide an app from non-Patrons completely. [Learn more](make-a-source.md#patreon-apps)

{% hint style="info" %}
If provided, the minimum pledge amount will be shown as the app's monthly price. For this reason, we recommend **always** providing a minimum pledge amount, even if you only have one tier.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For more fine-grain control, you can specify the exact tiers required for each app in your source's JSON. [Learn more](make-a-source.md#patreon-apps)
{% endhint %}



## Expired Pledges

Once a user's pledge expires, they'll no longer receive updates for your app(s) or be able to refresh them. This will cause these apps to expire after 7 days, after which they will no longer be able to be opened.

If they become a Patron again in the future, they will be able to use your apps like normal.



## Instructions

### <mark style="color:purple;">AltStore PAL</mark>

#### Upload the ADP

{% hint style="danger" %}
To ensure only Patrons can download your app, you must attach your ADPs to Patreon posts which have a limit of 200MB per attachment.
{% endhint %}

1. Create a new Patreon post
2. Attach all the files in your ADP, including `manifest.json`, `signature`, and all `.ipa` files

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you want to attach more than one ADP to the same Patreon post, you must rename `manifest.json` and `signature` to something unique.
{% endhint %}

3. Configure post visibility to limit which tiers can download it
4. Publish Patreon post

#### Update Your Source

1. Add the [`patreonURL` key](make-a-source.md#patreonurl-string) to your source JSON with your Patreon page's URL
2. Add a [Patreon](make-a-source.md#patreon-apps) object to your app's entry with the conditions required to download it (this should match the visibility of your Patreon post)
3. Use the published Patreon post's URL for your app version's `downloadURL`
4. If multiple ADPs are attached to the same Patreon post, add the [`assetURLs`](make-a-source.md#asseturls-dictionary-of-strings) key to your app's version and specify the URLs for `manifest.json` and `signature`&#x20;
5. Upload your source JSON to your server

#### Update Your Source

2. Use the copied attachment URL for your app's `downloadURL`
3. Add a [Patreon](make-a-source.md#patreon-apps) object to your app's entry with the conditions required to download it (this should match the visibility of your Patreon post).
4. If not yet added, add the `patreonURL` key to your source JSON with your Patreon page's URL (e.g https://www.patreon.com/rileyshane)
5. Upload your source JSON to your server
